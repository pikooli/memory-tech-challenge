This is a technical test for In The Memory.

It have nextjs, tailwind, i18n, fontawersome, moment, sass, chartjs.
It come from my boilerplate.

The goal is to take a datasets in csv and to show it on a dashboard.

The page should have 2 block :

1. Summary view
  This block  display the three following metrics:

  Total revenue
  
  Average revenue per order
  
  Number of unique customers
  
2. Monthly view

This block display a graph showing the evolution of total revenue by month.


We can filter the entire dashboard by Country.

The dataset have some date that are from 2 differents years. 
But is was not asket to hand mulptiple years, so i didn't hand the years.

I this test take me around 6-8 hours.
